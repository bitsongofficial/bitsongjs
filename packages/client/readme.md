# üì° @bitsongjs/client

This package defines an query client and tx client to interact with the bitsong chain, inside it there are also the definitions of the proto and amino files.

Feature list:
- Query client
- Tx client
- Proto definitions
- Amino definitions (compatibility with ledgers)

## üöÄ Tech Stack

Typescript, Lerna, NX, CosmJS

## ‚öôÔ∏è Build

## üìò Examples
The library exposes one main TypeScript class: the BitsongClient class.

We suggest using the [chain registry](https://github.com/cosmos/chain-registry) to get information about Bitsong, they also provide a [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chain-registry):

```ts
import { assets, chains, ibc } from 'chain-registry';

const chain = chains.find(({chain_name}) => chain_name==='bitsong');

console.log(chain);

const assetList = assets.find(({chain_name}) => chain_name==='bitsong');

console.log(assetList);
```

You can also get IBC denom and info by using the following [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@chain-registry/utils):
```ts
import { getIbcAssets } from '@chain-registry/utils';
import { assets, ibc } from 'chain-registry';

export const ibcMap = [
  ...getIbcAssets('osmosis', ibc, assets),
  ...getIbcAssets('juno', ibc, assets),
  ...getIbcAssets('bitsong', ibc, assets),
];
```

Here is an example of fetching the user's balance:

```ts
import { BitsongClient, Bech32PrefixAccAddr, MicroDenom } from '@bitsongjs/client';
import { QueryClientImpl } from '@bitsongjs/client/dist/codec/cosmos/bank/v1beta1/query';

const signer = await DirectSecp256k1HdWallet.fromMnemonic('YOUR MNEMONIC', {
    prefix: Bech32PrefixAccAddr,
    hdPaths: [stringToPath(getHdPath())],
});

const api = BitsongClient.connect({
    connection: {
        type: 'tendermint',
        endpoints: ['<YOUR RPC URL>'],
        signer, // OfflineSigner from @cosmjs/proto-signing
    },
});

const bankClient = new QueryClientImpl(api.queryClient);

const [firstAccount] = await signer.getAccounts();
const myAddress = firstAccount.address;

const balances = await bankClient.AllBalances({
	address: myAddress,
});

console.log(balances);
/*
    Prints example: `{
        "balances":[{"denom":"ubtsg","amount":"10000000000"}],
        "pagination":{"total":1}
    }`
*/

// Sign and broadcast a transaction with some x/bank MsgSend.
const msg = MsgSend.fromPartial({
  fromAddress: myAddress,
  toAddress: 'bitsong1...',
  amount: [{ amount: '1000000', denom: 'ubtsg' }],
});

// StdFee from @cosmjs/stargate
const fee = {
  amount: [
    {
      denom: MicroDenom,
      amount: '5000',
    },
  ],
  gas: '200000',
};

const txBytes = await api.txClient?.sign(
	myAddress,
	[msg],
	fee,
	'a memo text',
);

if (txBytes) {
	const deliverTxRes = await api.txClient?.broadcast(txBytes);
}
```
